# Greeter App
This repo provides a base agent, the Greeter app and a Makefile for setting up a python based [NDK](https://learn.srlinux.dev/ndk/intro/) development environment. Read more about the approach at [learn.srlinux.dev](https://learn.srlinux.dev/ndk/guide/env/python/).

## Features
The Greeter app demonstrates how agent can interact with the whole state and config tree of SR Linux using local gNMI access and the NDK.
- It subscribes to configuration using the NDK.
- It retrieves the `name` from the configuration notification and updates its own state with the greeting string `Hello {name}, my uptime is {last_booted}` where `last_booted` is retrieved from the `/system/information/last-booted` state datastore using gnmi.
  
## Quickstart
You need [conatinerlab](https://containerlab.dev/install/) to be installed. Minimum version is v0.31.0 to have Unix domain socket enabled. 

Clone the `greeter-app-python` branch.

Initialize the NDK project:
```console
make
```
Now you have all the components of an NDK app generated.

Build the lab and deploy the demo application:
```console
make redeploy-all
```
The app named `greeter` is now running the `srl1` and `srl2` containerlab nodes. The `name` configuration parameter defined in the YANG model is available and you can explore the logs of the app by reading the log file:
```console
tail -f logs/srl1/stdout/greeter.log
```
The greeter app logs will show "greeter/name not configured" on startup so you will have to modify the `greeter/name` configuration using the SR Linux CLI. 

## Modify Agent Configuration
Connect to the SR Linux CLI:
```console
ssh admin@clab-greeter-dev-srl1
```
Once connected switch to the candiate mode:
```console
enter candidate private
```
Change the configuration:
```console
set greeter name agent007
```
Commit the change:
```console
commit now
```
## App Deployment
Build a rpm file to deploy the app on hardware or vm by running this command:
 ```console
make build-app
```
The rpm file is located in /build. Copy the rpm on the SR Linux host and run:
```console
sudo rpm -U myrpm.rpm
```
The app is deployed and the last step is to reload the app-mgr by running this command in the SR Linux CLI:
```console
tools system app-management application app_mgr reload
```

## Test using Robot Framework
[Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) can be used to test the agent by running those commands:
### Build Robot Framework docker image
```console
make build-automated-test
```
### Test with dev lab already deployed
```console
make deploy-test-lab
```
```console
make test
```

### Test by deploying dev and test labs
```console
make redeploy_all_and_test
```
